# Log of 100DaysOfCode - done in 2019


### Day 1: April 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project MCalc. That's a basic matrix calculator. Actually methods for printing, filling, adding and the rough idea of multiplying matrices is implemented. Furthermore i got into GitHub commit, push and pull system.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be at coding.

### Day 2: April 2. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some bug hunting. Details like length-1 were the problems. The multiplication method for matrices works. If the multiplication is not definined for specific matrices, the program throws an exception. 

**Thoughts:** Today I did my exercise directly after getting up, so I didn't have any coffee and kinda tired. The conesquence was less efficiency, but finally I came on tours and solved some problems without any pressure. A good start for this day I think.

### Day 3: April 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new method for adding multiple matrices with a var args parameter. It's 80% working and I'm gonna fix the last mistakes today or tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's early in the morning and I forgot that an array is a static data structure in java XD So I figured the problem out.

### Day 4: April 4. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I finished and bugfixed all basic calculating methods. So I started implementing a simple command line user interface and got some ideas for it.

**Thoughts:** Today I started later with the challenge and it was much more effective and the concentration was better.

### Day 5: April 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I implemented the adding, multiplying, deleting, and inserting feature of the command line user interface. 80% done.

**Thoughts:** I did the challenge very lately today, but the work was easy, so I wrote many lines and they work.

### Day 6: April 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I implemented an input verfication for all methods and wrote down an idea how to finish the method for adding and multiplying with user input.

**Thoughts:** Nice weather and less motivation. Did my "work" anyway.
