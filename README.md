# Log of 100DaysOfCode - dont in 2019


### Day 1: April 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project MCalc. That's a basic matrix calculator. Actually methods for printing, filling, adding and the rough idea of multiplying matrices is implemented. Furthermore i got into GitHub commit, push and pull system.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be at coding.
