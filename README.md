# Log of 100DaysOfCode - done in 2019


### Day 1: April 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project MCalc. That's a basic matrix calculator. Actually methods for printing, filling, adding and the rough idea of multiplying matrices is implemented. Furthermore i got into GitHub commit, push and pull system.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be at coding.

### Day 2: April 2. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some bug hunting. Details like length-1 were the problems. The multiplication method for matrices works. If the multiplication is not definined for specific matrices, the program throws an exception. 

**Thoughts:** Today I did my exercise directly after getting up, so I didn't have any coffee and kinda tired. The conesquence was less efficiency, but finally I came on tours and solved some problems without any pressure. A good start for this day I think.
