# Log of 100DaysOfCode - done in 2019


### Day 1: April 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project MCalc. That's a basic matrix calculator. Actually methods for printing, filling, adding and the rough idea of multiplying matrices is implemented. Furthermore i got into GitHub commit, push and pull system.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be at coding.

### Day 2: April 2. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some bug hunting. Details like length-1 were the problems. The multiplication method for matrices works. If the multiplication is not definined for specific matrices, the program throws an exception. 

**Thoughts:** Today I did my exercise directly after getting up, so I didn't have any coffee and kinda tired. The conesquence was less efficiency, but finally I came on tours and solved some problems without any pressure. A good start for this day I think.

### Day 3: April 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new method for adding multiple matrices with a var args parameter. It's 80% working and I'm gonna fix the last mistakes today or tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's early in the morning and I forgot that an array is a static data structure in java XD So I figured the problem out.

### Day 4: April 4. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I finished and bugfixed all basic calculating methods. So I started implementing a simple command line user interface and got some ideas for it.

**Thoughts:** Today I started later with the challenge and it was much more effective and the concentration was better.

### Day 5: April 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I implemented the adding, multiplying, deleting, and inserting feature of the command line user interface. 80% done.

**Thoughts:** I did the challenge very lately today, but the work was easy, so I wrote many lines and they work.

### Day 6: April 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I implemented an input verfication for all methods and wrote down an idea how to finish the method for adding and multiplying with user input.

**Thoughts:** Nice weather and less motivation. Did my "work" anyway.

### Day 7: April 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I expanded the deleting method for multiple matrices. The problem is, that the indices change after deleting the first matrix. So I need to fix it. The rest works.

**Thoughts:** First week done. Tomorrow classes begin and the challenge really starts for me, coz I have less time.

### Day 8: April 8. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned some C and wrote a guessing numbers game for command line input.

**Thoughts:** Little bit tired of my Java project. I am only bugfixing and it's not really...interesting. Furthermore the new Semester term started, so I needed something relaxing and interesting today.

### Day 9: April 9. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with learning C. I got into pointers.

**Thoughts:** My time was very limited. My Java project will be continued, but today I was only motivated to learn some C.

### Day 10: April 10. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I struggled a lot. I started making a Sudoku Tester without any help. Not easy...

**Thoughts:** I am not used to C and I was tired.

### Day 11: April 11. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote some lines using quicksort and pointers. I learned about function pointers, structs and typedefs.

**Thoughts:** Pretty new things when coming from Java

### Day 16: April 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to C and implemented some simple programs using pointers.

**Thoughts:** Pointers are difficult for me, because I am totaly not used to them from Java.
